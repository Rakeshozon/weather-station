# weather-station
a DIY weather station using humidity-sensor

# purpose of the project
we really can have a good weather reporter and really have satellite to predict it up , but most of the time it wont be a constant for a place , suppose if US newyork is said to have 23 c or 100 F in the morning , it doesnt mean throughout the new york it will have stablised/constant temperature , hence to solve it i have created a weather station using humidity sensor
